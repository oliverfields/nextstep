# NextAction🎬️

NextAction is a lightweight, narrative-driven framework that helps small teams stay focused on the next task by tracking actions with simple, clear language. It evolves dynamically with the project, providing flexibility and clarity without the complexity of rigid systems.

## 1. Comparison to Scrum:

Scrum is a well-defined framework primarily used for software development teams. It breaks down work into sprints, backlogs, and structured ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc. Scrum relies on specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) and sets a formal cadence for reviewing and adjusting the project.

NextAction on the other hand is much lighter and more flexible. It's not as prescriptive as Scrum, and it doesn't impose specific roles or ceremonies. Instead, it’s focused on keeping the team aligned on the next action, which is key to maintaining forward momentum.

### Key Differences:

Cadence: Scrum has fixed sprint cycles, usually 1-4 weeks, whereas NextAction doesn’t rely on sprints. It’s driven by the next action at any time, with teams meeting as needed (e.g., regular narrative sessions).

Roles: Scrum requires defined roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner, while NextAction has no such formal roles. The focus is on the team’s collective effort rather than individual responsibility defined by role.

Backlogs: Scrum uses a backlog to store tasks and manage them, while NextAction tracks tasks directly in the narrative file itself—it's more organic, evolving in real time.

Meetings: Scrum has structured ceremonies (e.g., daily stand-ups), but NextAction is focused on narrative sessions, which are more fluid, less formal, and can be customized for each team.

### Where NextAction is Different from Scrum:

Narrative-Driven: Rather than organizing tasks by fixed sprints or backlogs, NextAction uses a storytelling approach to track work. This provides more flexibility and makes it easier to see how tasks evolve within the bigger picture.

Focus on "What's Next": Scrum's focus is on completing tasks within a sprint, whereas NextAction focuses solely on identifying the next step. This makes it more agile and adaptable.

## 2. Comparison to Kanban:

Kanban is a visual project management method that emphasizes continuous delivery and flow. Work items are visualized on a board (e.g., in columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done") to maximize efficiency and throughput. Kanban also promotes limiting work in progress (WIP) and encourages continuous flow.

NextAction shares some similarities with Kanban in that it also focuses on actions and task flow, but the key distinction is in how the tasks are tracked and represented.

### Key Differences:

Visual Board vs. Narrative File: Kanban uses a visual board with columns (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"), while NextAction uses a text-based narrative file to track actions. The Kanban board is useful for teams that prefer visualizing their workflow, whereas NextAction focuses more on a linear, written narrative of tasks.

Task Flow: Kanban focuses on continuous flow and WIP limits to prevent bottlenecks, while NextAction focuses on the next step in a more free-form, adaptive narrative. There’s no hard limit on how many actions can be in progress at once, though teams are encouraged to maintain focus on the most important next action.

Board vs. Documentation: Kanban is more visual, relying on boards and cards (e.g., Trello, Jira), while NextAction is centered around documentation (like markdown or wiki files) that is continuously updated as the team progresses. It’s more text-driven and can be implemented in any environment, whether it’s a shared file or a more structured wiki or wiki-based tool.

### Where NextAction is Similar to Kanban:

Action Tracking: Both frameworks focus on tracking individual tasks, but NextAction has a more streamlined approach where tasks are marked as either ACTION or DONE.

Flow: Like Kanban, NextAction encourages teams to keep tasks moving forward, by always having the next action ready to go.

## 3. Where NextAction Excels:

Flexibility: Unlike Scrum and Kanban, which are structured, NextAction🎬️ is more lightweight and adaptable. It can be used for any type of project (not just software development) and doesn’t require the overhead of complex roles, ceremonies, or tools.

Narrative Focus: The focus on storytelling and next steps creates a more human-readable approach. This is ideal for teams who want to see the broader narrative of their work unfolding over time without getting bogged down in strict frameworks or complex task boards.

Simplicity: If a team is looking for a simple, no-frills way to stay organized and move forward, NextAction is less cumbersome than Scrum or Kanban, both of which require tools and sometimes significant process overhead to maintain.

## 4. When to Choose NextAction:

When you have a small team that works collaboratively but needs a flexible, straightforward way to track progress.

When your projects are constantly evolving and the team needs to adapt and reprioritize frequently.

When you want to keep the focus on action, without the complexity of a backlog or sprint-based cadence.

## 5. When to Choose Scrum or Kanban:

Scrum is best if your team needs a rigorous framework with defined roles, ceremonies, and sprints to manage more complex projects or deliverables.

Kanban is ideal if you have a steady flow of work and want to optimize throughput by visualizing task statuses and limiting WIP (work in progress).

## In Summary:

NextAction is less prescriptive than Scrum and Kanban, making it easier for smaller teams to stay focused on the next step while maintaining flexibility and simplicity.

Scrum and Kanban are more structured and suited for larger teams with more formalized workflows.

NextAction is designed for teams who need to stay agile and dynamic, constantly iterating and adjusting their next actions while still keeping a clear narrative of progress.

In essence, NextAction is ideal for smaller teams looking for lightweight task management without the overhead of more rigid frameworks, allowing them to stay flexible and adaptable as projects unfold.
