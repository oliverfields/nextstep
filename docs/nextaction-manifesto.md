# NextAction🎬 Manifesto

## We believe in forward motion over status reporting

Projects move forward through **action**, not observation. We don't track work—we do it. Our framework exists to coordinate what's next, not to measure what's behind us.

## We believe in conversation over ceremony

The work happens in narrative sessions where teams talk, decide, and align. The written narrative is just the persistent memory of those conversations. We reject elaborate metadata, complex workflows, and tools that try to replace human discussion.

## We believe in one story, told together

Every project has a narrative. Tasks without context are just noise. We write our work as a living document where actions, decisions, and insights evolve together. The story of the project *is* the project.

## We believe in doing over planning

We identify the next action, not the next hundred actions. We trust that clarity emerges through work, not through exhaustive upfront planning. The narrative evolves as we learn.

## We believe in tools that get out of the way

A text file. A conversation. A commit. That's it. We refuse complexity that doesn't serve the work. Version control is our timeline. The file is our dashboard. The narrative session is our process.

## We believe blocking is temporary, motion is constant

When something can't move, we find something that can. We don't elaborate on obstacles—we route around them. The framework doesn't track blockers because the framework only cares about what's next.

## We believe small teams need less, not more

Lightweight teams die under heavyweight process. We stay small, we stay aligned, and we stay focused. NextAction🎬 is for teams who trust each other enough to just talk and work.
